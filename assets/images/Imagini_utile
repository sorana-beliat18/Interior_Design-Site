The contents of the file /interior-design-website/interior-design-website/src/assets/images/Imagini_utile will be the images you want to include in your project. Since I cannot access the actual images from your "Imagini utile" folder, I will provide a structure for how you can organize your images within that folder. You can replace the placeholders with your actual image files.

Here is the suggested structure for the images folder:

- image1.jpg
- image2.jpg
- image3.jpg
- image4.jpg
- image5.jpg
- before_after1.jpg
- before_after2.jpg
- bedroom_design1.jpg
- kitchen_design1.jpg
- bathroom_design1.jpg
- living_room_design1.jpg

You can add your actual image files with appropriate names in the /src/assets/images/Imagini_utile directory.
